# Rust Template for Competitive Programming

Contains simple input & output utilities that are convenient to use and ensures
that you're not bottlenecked by slow IO performance.

## Setting up Rust

[Rustup] is by far the most convenient way to install and manage Rust toolchain
versions. By default, it will use the latest stable release which should be just
fine for starting out.

For editor support, there is [rust-analyzer]. It works as a [VsCode extension],
or generally in anything that supports the Language Server Protocol (vim,
neovim, etc.). Alternatively, CLion also has Rust support built in.
